# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is a Simple Rock paper Scissor game developed using python library opencv and Deep learning Model.

Deep Learning model is used in game.ipynb to predict the user's move,so you have to train your model on your own
because i can not upload it to GitHub due to its large size(more than 100MB).

But Dataset and code is shared so it will be easy for you to train model.

Or If you want the model , You can drop me an email on vasugarg719@gmail.com
